# Wheat Germ Buns

### Ingredients
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 package (1 scant tablespoon) active dry yeast 1 cup warm water (105-115 degrees F)
* 1 egg
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil (preferably canola)
* 0.25 cup lightly packed brown sugar
* 0.25 teaspoon salt (optional)
* 0.333 cup wheat germ
* 3 cups (approximately) all-purpose flour

###Steps
* Preheat the oven to 375Â° F.
* In a large bowl, sprinkle the 1 teaspoon of sugar and the yeast over the warm water, stirring the ingredients to dissolve them.
* Let the mixture stand for 10 minutes or until the yeast starts to foam.
* Stir in the egg, oil, brown sugar, salt (if desired), wheat germ, and 1.25 cups of the flour.
* Beat the mixture until it is smooth, then add enough of the remaining flour to make a dough that is easy to handle.
* Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board, and knead the dough for about 2 minutes.
* Form the dough into a ball, and place the dough in an oiled bowl, turning the dough to coat it on all sides with the oil.
* Cover the bowl, and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1.5 hours or until the dough has doubled in bulk.
* Punch down the dough, and shape it into balls about 1.75 inches in diameter. (You may have to grease your hands since the dough tends to be slightly sticky.)
* Place the dough balls in greased cake pans, leaving enough space between the balls for a rising that will double the bulk of the dough.
* Cover the pans, and let the buns rise in a warm, draft-free place for 45 minutes or until the buns have doubled in bulk.
* Place the pans in the hot oven, and bake the buns for 20 to 25 minutes or until the buns are browned.

### Notes
* The buns can also be made with a combination of flours--for example, 2 cups fo all-purpose flour and 1 cup of whole-wheat flour, resulting in somewhat heavier rolls.
