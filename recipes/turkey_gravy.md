# Turkey Gravy

## Ingredients
* 2 pounds turkey wings
* 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 medium onion halved
* 4 coarsely chopped carrots
* 1 head garlic, smashed
* 0.5 bunch fresh sage
* 0.5 bunch fresh thyme
* 8 black peppercorns
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 0.25 cup all-purpose flour
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.

* Put the turkey wings (turkey and neck if you've got it) into a small roasting pan and roast them until they are golden brown, about 30 minutes.
* Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat.
* Add the onion, carrots, garlic, herbs, and peppercorns and cook for 5 minutes.
* Add the turkey wings.
* Pour some water into the roasting pan and scrape up all the browned bits on the bottom; add this to the pot.
* Cover everything in the pot with cold water by 1-inch and bring to the boil, skimming any foam that rises to the surface.
* Reduce the heat and simmer for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
* Strain out the solids and discard.
* Wipe out the pot and put it over medium heat.
* Melt the butter with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and add the flour.
* Cook this roux, stirring frequently, until it is golden brown.
* Slowly whisk in the strained stock being careful to work out any lumps.
* Cook until the gravy has thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes.
