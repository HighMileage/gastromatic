* 3 eggs
* 0.5 teaspoon cinnamon
* 0.25 teaspoon nutmeg

* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
* Make the crust by combining the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl.

* Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up the sides of a springform pan.
* You don't want the crust to form all of the way up the back of each slice of cheesecake.
* Bake the crust for 5 minutes, then set it aside until you are ready to fill it.
* In a large mixing bowl combine the cream cheese 1 cup sugar, and vanilla.
* Mix with an electric mixer until smooth.
* Add the pumpkin, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice and continue to beat until smooth and creamy.
* Pour the filling into the pan.
* Make for 60 to 70 minutes.

* Remove from the oven and allow the cheesecake to cool.
* When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it in the refrigerator.
